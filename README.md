JWST Cycle1 Exoplanets in Transmission

Code to create a plot showing the radius and equilibrium temperature of the transiting exoplanets to be observed during JWST's first year.
Now updated to include code to include the Cycle 2 transiting exoplanets.

The exoplanets observed by HST and Spitzers were gathered from the NASA Exopanet Archive and are not guaranteed to be complete.
